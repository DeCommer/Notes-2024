## <span style="color: dodgerblue">Project Planning

In a **<span style="color: dodgerblue">predictive environment</span>** there is a significant upfront investment on planning. The plans are revisited periodically.

In an **<span style="color: dodgerblue">Adaptive environment</span>**, planning is done throughout the project. Imminent work takes priority.

## <span style="color: deeppink">"Iron Triangle" / "Triple constraints"

### <span style="color: darkorange">Schedule, cost, and scope

The fixed cost and schedule in **<span style="color: dodgerblue">Adaptive project</span>** are fixed. (Funnel where scope is on top).<br>
The flexible cost and schedule in a **<span style="color: dodgerblue">predictive project</span>** are more fluid (Pyramid, where scope is on the bottom)

## <span style="color: deeppink">Quality in Project Management

Subjective, totality of an entity the satisfies stated or implied needs.

Various grades of products and service. Something can be low grade, but still made  or delivered with quality.

**Quality is:**
- Totality of an entity
- Satisfies needed abilities
- Stated or implied needs

**Quality processes**
- Quality planning
- Quality assurance (QA)
- Quality control (QC)

Planning is an iterative process<br>
PMI theme: PLAN, IMPLEMENT, MEASURE, REACT -- and document<br>
If the product is not acceptable, the project is not finished<br>
Must meet scope to achieve quality

### <span style="color: darkorange">Cost of Quality

**Cost of comformance / quality to requirements**
- safety measures
- Team development and training
- Proper materials and processes

**Cost of non-comformance / poor quality to requirements**
- Liabilities
- Rework/scrap
- Lost business

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Prevention:** QA, Delivier the exact project scope and expected quality.<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples** Training, safety measures, and right tools and equipment 

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Appraisal:** QC, Cost of measuring, testing, auditing, and evaluating

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Failure:** Internal failure: (Escape defect) Scrap and rework<br>
External failure: loss of sales, loss of customers, downtime, and damage to reputation.

### <span style="color: darkorange">Quality management plan

![fishbone diagram](image.png)

Conduct statistical QC, sampling and probabilities<br>
Inspections audits, walkthrough, and attribute and variable sampling<br>
- attribute sampling: defective or not?
- Variable sampling: How defective? how far from acceptance?
- control limits
- Data gathering and analysis
- checklists, tally sheet
- Testing

QA - prevention driven

## <span style="color: deeppink">Risks in Project Management

Risk is uncertain

### <span style="color: darkorange">Qualitative risk analysis
- Prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action
- Assesment of probability of occurrence and impact
- Focues efforts on high-priority risks
- Fast and quick
- Not all risks need qualitative risk analysis

|Risk           |Probability|Impact  |Risk Score|
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
|Data Loss      |Low        |High    |Moderate  |
|Network speed  |Moderate   |Moderate|Moderate  |
|Server downtime|High       |Low     |Moderate  |
|Email down     |Low        |Low     |Low       |

identified risk           Subjective score

### <span style="color: darkorange">Preparining for quantitative risk avalysis

ranking risk by priority - usually associated with cost

prob * impact = ex$v(Expected monetary value)

<span style="color: dodgerblue"> Managing negative risks: </span>
Escalating, Avoiding, Transferring, Mitigating, Accepting

<span style="color: dodgerblue">Managing positive risks: </span>
Escalating, Exploiting, Sharing, Enhancing, Accespting
