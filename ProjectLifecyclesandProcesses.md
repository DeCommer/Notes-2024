# <span style="color: dodgerblue"> Project Lifecycles and Processes

### <span style="color: gold">Projects
- Temporary effort
- Goal and deliverables
- Start and end dates
- clear scope and objectives (key performance indicators)
- Specific resources and budget

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** building a bridge, developing a new software application, renovating a house<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Advantages:** Agile, responsive to change, focus on specific goals<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Disadvantages:** Risky, potential for faliure, limited scope

### <span style="color: gold">Programs
- Group of related **projects** that work towards a common objective
-  Multiple **projects** with interdependencies
- Larger scope than a single project
- Longer timeline

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** Government infrustructure development, employee training, research and development<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Advantages:** Efficient, cost-effective, coordination of multiple projects<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Disadvantages:** Complex, coordination challenges, longer timeline

### <span style="color: gold">Portfolios
- Collection of **projects** , **programs** , and operations that align with strategic objectives
- Broad scope that encompasses all work within an organization
- Used to manage and prioritize **projects**  and **programs**

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** product portfolio, large building construction<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Advantages:** Strategic, alginment with long-term goals, broad scope<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Disadvantages:** Difficulty in managing and aligning with changing priorities, broad scope

## <span style="color: tomato">Project Vs Operations

Projects are unique  nad have and end date, while operations on ongoing indefinitely. 

- Projects have a defined budget
- Operations have ongoing costs
- Operations involve onfgoing productions

## <span style="color: tomato">Predictive Vs. Adaptive Approach

### <span style="color: gold">Predictive Projects
- Assumption that the future can be accurately predicted based on past trends and data
- Involves long-term planning to predict future events or outcomes
- Detailed plans and budgets
- Allows for more accurate forcasting and planning
- May be less flexible and less able to adapt to unexpected changes

<span style="color: dodgerblue">Waterfall</span> - each phase ends and sets up next phase

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** Financial planning, Construction, Manufacturing

### <span style="color: gold">Adaptive Projects
- Assumption that the future is uncertain and subject to change
- Flexible plannign and decision-making
- Ability to adapt to changing circumstances
- Shot-term planning and focus on quick adaptation
- More flexible and able to adapt to unexpected changes
- May be less efficient and more costly due to frequent adjustments

<span style="color: dodgerblue">Iterative</span> - Circular loop: Sprint planning, (do work), sprint retrospective, then back to sprint planning.

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** Software delevlopment, Marketing, Crisis management, events - changes in attendance, weather, etc.

## <span style="color: tomato">Project management Life Cycle

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">IPEMCC** - Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing

The Monitoring and Controlling phase can lead back to planning

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Agile:** Vision -> User Story -> Product Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> daily ("stand ups" meeting) / 2 -4 weeks sprint -> Product Increment -> Sprint Review -> Retrospective

## <span style="color: tomato">Risk / Issue / Assumptions / Constraints
- Uncertain event of condition (What are the chances)
- Positive or negative effect
- Scales of probability and impact
- Identified, analyzed, documented, response
- Risk register (Log or database, excel, etc.)

### <span style="color: gold">Risks
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Pure Risk:** - Loss of life or limb, danger, always negative
    - safety measures, people could die
    - Electrical work and licensing<br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Business Risk:** - Loss of investment, positive or negative, time ro cost savings, no one will die.

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples of Risk:** Technical failure, data security, dependencies, scheduling, budget, resource

### <span style="color: gold">Issues
 -Risk that has occurred, issue log, issue owner, resolution plan/date, <br>
**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples of Issues:** - data security, employees leave, dependecies on external resources.
### <span style="color: gold">Assumptions

 -Believe to be true but not proven. May be risk.

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** Availability of resources, stakeholder support, technical feasibility, legal and regulatory compliance

### <span style="color: gold">Constriants
-Anything that limits options, requirements for the project

**<span style="color: dodgerblue">Examples:** Budget, Deadline, Must Finish On /Must Start On (MFO/MSO), Resources,  Vendors, Requirements

## <span style="color: tomato">Project Scope

Defining the project scope
- defines the boundaries of a project
- Outlines what will be includded or excluded
- detailes description of objectives, deliverables, and requirements
